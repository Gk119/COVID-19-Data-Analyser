Firstly, I would like to thank the dedicated volunteers behind covid19india.org ,
who curate and verify the data coming from several sources, from where the necessary
datasets for this project was obtained.

This project is an analysis and visualization of the COVID-19 Virus cases in Kerala 
and India. The relevant data for the project was obtained from covid19india.org 
which contains the curated data from various state bulletins and official handles 
that are publicly available. Proper effort was put from our part in ensuring that 
the program is user friendly and can be used with ease for the required purpose.

The project is built using Python programming language and the concepts such as the 
use of DataFrames, CSV file management and Data visualization using matplotlib 
library is used throughout the project. The program contains the detailed data on 
cases of the virus in Kerala (state and district wise) and the National cases. The 
user has the option to plot the data of any of the above mentioned domains or 
retrieve the data of particular dates in the raw form for detailed analysis. 
The purpose of this project is to allow the analysis and visualization on the 
existing condition and trends of the novel corona virus in our country and state 
which will help the officials and citizens to take the necessary measures or make 
predictions based on the continuing trends. The visualizations can also be downloaded 
for educational purposes or be used to spread awareness about the virus. All the 
sources used and links for further reading are present in the end of the document

The project was initiated by keeping in mind the easy access to data of the 
pertaining to the COVID-19 situation in the country and its visualization 
available for students and others in an easy and user friendly manner for 
educational or research purposes. The scope of the project includes ensuring 
the availability of raw data along with the project package, plotting the above 
said data in various groups for making comparisons or one at a time, or retrieval 
of the data for specific dates for the cases in national and Kerala state/district 
level. However, the state/district wise analysis of other states are out of the scope 
of the project and the necessary data of these can be downloaded from the sites 
mentioned in sources. The comparison of this project with the existing method, its 
advantages/disadvantages are given below.
